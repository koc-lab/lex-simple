Where, as here, a prisoner challenges the very fact or duration of his physical imprisonment, and he requests the determination that he should be released immediately or more speedily, his only federal solution is an order of bringing him before a court.

The clause in this case limits the payment of attorney’s fees to “charges caused by the administration of the Trust.” Restated Revocable Living Trust dated May 1, 2006, DN 27-6, p. 13.
Conversely, when the majority of the evidence weighs against the claim, “[the Board] necessarily has determined that the evidence is not ‘nearly equal’ or ‘too close to call,’ and the benefit of the doubt rule therefore has no application.” Ortiz v. Principi 274 F.3d 1361, 1365 (Fed.Cir.2001).
Broad preventive bans that fail to ‘respond exactly to the substantive problem which lawfully concerns’ the State cannot resist intermediate examination.” 838 F.3d at 73 (quoting Members of City Council of City of L.A. v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U.S. 789, 810, 104 S.Ct.

Although the Plaintiff asks for the termination of the note and mortgage in his Complaint, he argues that deciding whether Blake properly terminated the promissory note does not require the Court to exercise jurisdiction over the property. It also does not result in the Court awarding possession of the property to any party.
The contracting officer wants to choose the approach that provides the best overall value to the Government. He understands that the importance of cost or price may change. For example, cost or price may play affect source selection when the requirement is clearly definable and the risk that parties are unsuccessful to execute the contract is low.
First, the court must examine the elements of a claim. Second, the court should identify claims that are no more than conclusions, which cannot be assumed as true. Finally, the court should assume the accuracy of well-defended claims, and determine whether they reasonably give rise to an entitlement for relief.
He alleged three federal claims. The first claim is that the defendants, acting individually, jointly, and in conspiracy, deprived Beaman of a fair trial by hiding evidence, which could be used to prove Brady’s claims case (individual liability). The second claim is that the defendants conspired to deprive Beaman of evidence that could be used to prove Beaman’s case(conspiracy liability). The third claim is that the defendants should have prevented the violation of his rights but did not (failure to intervene liability).

DeFlanders (“DeFlanders”) appeals from the decisions of the United States of Appeals for Veterans Claims (“Veterans Court”), approving the decisions of the Board of Veterans’ Appeals (“The Board”): (i) finding that DeFlanders had not submitted new and material evidence sufficient to reopen claims for a service-connected disability compensation for a left knee disability and spots on the lungs; (ii) denying compensation for spots on the brain; and (iii) denying a disability rating in excess of 10% for non-cardiac chest pain.
Briefly stated, the Secretary’s argument that §4.85(a) requires the effective date for an increased disability claim to be set in accordance with the date a Maryland CNC test is administered, not only adds words to the regulation that are not there, but it also conflicts with the plain meaning of section 5110(b)(3), which requires the effective date of an award of increased compensation to be “the earliest date as of which it is conclusive than an increase in disability had occurred.” 38 U.S.C
Given the decision in Koloms, the question remaining for the Court, then, is whether the underlying suits are like the furnace leak in Koloms, namely, the type of isolated, ordinary result from day-to-day operations and properly covered, or whether they arise from “traditional environmental pollution.” Though it may be more art than science to determine when the isolated consequences of normal business operations end and “traditional environmental pollution” begins, the instant case falls cleanly within the definition.
Works Co. are: (1) the defendant's good faith effort to comply with the statute: (2) the defendant's degree of fault; (3) the defendant’s history of previous violations; (4) the nature of the public interest in ensuring compliance with the regulations involved; (5) the nature and circumstances of the violation at issue; (6) the seriousness of the violation; (7) the defendant’s ability to pay; (8) the appropriateness of the size of the penalty to the defendant’s business and the effect of a penalty on the defendant’s ability to continue doing business; (9) that the penalty not otherwise be highly unjust to the observer; (10) the economic benefit gained by the defendant through the violation; (11) the degree of harm to the public; (12) the value of clearing the agency authority of blame; (13) whether the party sought to be protected by the statute had been adequately compensated for the harm; and (14) such other matters as justice may require.
In its negligence claim, the Claimant alleges that Defendant Nonindustrial Disability Insurance’s (NDI) which provides partial wage replacement to eligible State employees who have a loss of wages due to a non-work-related disability, potentially negligent on some conduct included. It is failing to ensure an appropriate chain of custody of the sample in question and failing to share with Claimant and the testing facilities all factors that could affect or influence testing. Also it is failing to consider and eliminate all factors that could improperly influence testing, failing to prevent "false positives" and/or reporting of test results and failing to have pre-test discussions with Claimant to rule out irregularities that could and/or did affect testing. Lastly the NDI is failing to maintain and/or ensure the maintenance of appropriate quality control testing and/or reporting mechanisms and/or protocols; failing to comply with applicable procedures, regulations, protocols and/or laws regarding reporting and/or testing; and failing to monitor and/or control the compliance of others.
For instance, the Two Left Feet treatment supplements the real amateur competitors with a few “goofballs” for “comic relief of course,” and “a few ringers to make the other guys envious and competitive.” Likewise, the treatment describes one host as an “ex law enforcement officer, federal agent, with a masters degree in Social Work,” who would use this background to “manipulate” the other host, a “biochemist with a cool analytical nature, yet a vicious temper,” and who would focus on analyzing competitors using various scientific parameters, such as “bodyfat” and other statistics.

Bass v. First Pac
The guidelines in the 2005 Flow Plan are set clearly in “SunTrust Mortgage guidelines that are currently being used and have been mutually agreed upon.” The partial integration policy is unlike this guideline in a few situations.

A federal court may give extra decisions over state law if the state law claims are closely related to the main claims in the case. However, if the court dismisses all the primary claims, it can choose not to handle the state law claims. If it's not more efficient, convenient, and fair for everyone involved, the court should be cautious about handling state law claims. Because the Plaintiffs' complaint doesn't have a valid federal claim, and because this case is in the early stages of the legal process, the Court declines to give extra decisions over the Plaintiffs' state law claims right now.
The Thurman opinion doesn't have any evidence that the plaintiff challenged the use of the limit provision because of the change in the company's structure. However, this Court considers the Sixth Circuit's application of the Chrysler Corporation provision as helpful.

But even if the Plaintiff does that and proves a clear case of retaliation because "there is evidence that the unfair job action was partly motivated by protected speech, the government can avoid legal action if it can show that it would have taken the same action even without the protected speech." Heil v. Santoro, 147 F.3d 103, 109 (2d Cir.1998).
Also, any such conclusion is contradicted by Commerce's mention of its final decision in the case of Galvanized Steel and Wire From the People's Republic of China, which describes that Commerce's offsetting practice for the AD cash deposit rate is based on the idea that domestic subsidies have an equal impact on both export and domestic prices.
Ms. Swanson also says that the Veterans Court didn't make the right decision on an issue, but she doesn't back up this claim with anything other than the phrase "controversies to which the United States shall be a part" and mentions two Supreme Court cases related to the power of the courts under Article III.

The Board also concluded that the medical evidence available, particularly the report from the examiner in 2011, indicated that the cause was other injuries that happened after his service, as well as the natural effects of aging and his job as a truck driver.

Similarly, the fact that the rule allows for one additional evaluation "extra-schedular evaluation" based on the "disability or disabilities" suggests that the referral for such an evaluation can be based on the overall impact of all the veteran's disabilities.
Taking into account the policy and reason behind Rule 13(a), the court allowed the claim to proceed because it didn't see any indication of the "circuity of action that Rule 13(a) was aimed at preventing," since the plaintiffs were obligated to bring multiple actions according to the law.

Plaintiff concedes that her wrongful discharge claim “does not fit within the restrictions of the WLAD, FMLA or WFLA because she did not meet the required number of hours worked in the year previous to the accrual of her claim.”
Because the State of South Dakota filed suit on its own accord in state court in this case, at a time of its own choosing, with its hand-picked defendants, no such unjust prejudice is present, and FAG Bearings can appropriately be acclaimed.
The Government has called at trial two so-called “cooperating witnesses,” ie, alleged co-conspirators of the defendants who have pleaded guilty and who are “cooperating” with the Government by testifying at trial in hopes of receiving a sentence cut.
A farmout agreement is "[a] very common form of agreement between operators, whereby a lease owner not eager for drilling at the time agrees to assign the lease, or some part of it (in common or in severalty) to another operator who is desirous of drilling the tract."
To the extent Mr. Washington argues that the Veterans Court should have decided the gunshot wound claim in his favor without requiring a remand, he raises truthful .issues of adequacy of the evidence concerning his duty status at the time he was shot, and issues of his reliability.
The Fourth Circuit reasoned that Geriatric Release does pot provide juveniles with the chance to acquire release “based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation,” as required by Graham, because the Parole Board has the authority to reject release “for any reason whatsoever.”
Before this court, Mr. Smith characterizes the Plan as a settlement agreement and states that the Veterans Court failed to “enforce” the settlement agreement; Mr. Smith demands that we remand his case to the Veterans Court with instructions that it “enforce” the settlement agreement approved by this court in NOVA.
In this case, where the plaintiff has not created time-sheets and the defendant has failed to respond, the Court will accept Martinez’s declaration, submitted under the penalty of perjury, as to the hours she worked and wages she received, except to the extent that her statement seeks comfort beyond that sought in the complaint.
In all, the development of the Plan brought an action of shifting and re-shifting parts of the County from one district to another, reviewing the resdlt, and trying again.” The Commissioners deferred greatly to Brace in developing the remedial plans, and further deferred to Brace and their attorneys regarding the plans’ legality.
The quagmire of alternative definitions for offense on a female is further highlighted in the more current cases arising out of the North Carolina appellate courts, which seem to recognize proof of either force or violence, specifically in cases where a battery based on force alone, even if only slight, provides the basis for the “assault” component of the crime.
The Wisconsin Supreme Court finalized that chapter 980 did not require dismissal of Gilbert’s commitment petition because the chapter does not contain language permitting for dismissal in his circumstances, does not arrange a time period for execution of a commitment order, and provides that an individual may be simultaneously committed under chapter 980 and incarcerated at a DOC facility.
