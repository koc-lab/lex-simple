This, he says, is because the danger of unfair prejudice significantly outweighs the evidential value.
Although we believe that the NTSB acted arbitrarily and capriciously in refusing to consider state law requiring Petitioner to pay for legal representation, we highlight several issues on which we have not decided. These issues are left open to the NTSB. Additionally, based on the statute at issue, we hold that Petitioner was subject to fees that entitle him to change fees.

The agency needs to activate its machines and improvement processes. Fed.

Obviously, and to the extent further discussion of essential character is even necessary here: the essence of pots and pans is to contain and cook, and they can serve those functions with or without lids; and while lids may complete or boost that purpose, they are only incidental there to and serve no purpose otherwise without the pots/pans to which they are intended to be fitted or combined.

Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 475, 500, 93 S.Ct.
At oral argument, ST argued that it is clear that no subsequent premium that is paid by the insured to the insurer in order to keep the policy in operation and avail the benefits of the policy accordingly is due under ST’s premium plan because the document setting forth the premium plan, the 2005 Flow Plan, nowhere mentions these premiums being due after the MCL is reached.
