Although we believe that the NTSB acted arbitrarily and capriciously in refusing to consider state law requiring Petitioner to pay for legal representation, we highlight several issues on which we have not decided. These issues are left open to the NTSB. Additionally, based on the statute at issue, we hold that Petitioner was subject to fees that entitle him to change fees.

Obviously, and to the extent further discussion of essential character is even necessary here: the essence of pots and pans is to contain and cook, and they can serve those functions with or without lids; and while lids may complete or boost that purpose, they are only incidental there to and serve no purpose otherwise without the pots/pans to which they are intended to be fitted or combined.
Moreover, under section 5121, a determination of whether benefits that benefits that the deceased claiment has earned based on his service or other criteria, but that are payable to him at some later date should be awarded “must be determined based on evidence that was either'physically or constructively in the [deceased claimant’s] file at the time of his death.” Ralston v.

However, because the Court had previously cancelled those additional arguments during the September 7 session in court, and because the Court specifically narrowed Defendant's supplemental argument to the issue of § 6308, and because Defendant’s reply raises new issues insofar as neither its supplemental filing nor Plaintiff's response raised those issues, the Court rejects those argument out of hand.
