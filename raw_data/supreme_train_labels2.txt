First, he argues that the second degree court abused its discretion in admitting the 2006 interview clips, his letter to the prisoner, and the facts he acknowledged in his plea agreement to the 2006 crime. This, he says, is because the danger of unfair prejudice significantly outweighs the evidential value.
Although we believe that the NTSB acted arbitrarily and capriciously in refusing to consider state law requiring Petitioner to pay for legal representation, we highlight several issues on which we have not decided. These issues are left open to the NTSB. Additionally, based on the statute at issue, we hold that Petitioner was subject to fees that entitle him to change fees.

However, The Court directly rejects those arguments, because the Court had previously dismissed those additional arguments during the September 7 hearing, and because the Court specifically narrowed Defendant's additional argument to the issue regarding the purchase, consumption, possession, or transportation of liquor or malt or brewed beverages, and because Defendant’s reply raises new issues to the arguments made so far, and as none of its additional filing nor Plaintiff's response raised those issues.
The closest Williams argues that a court standard called “Baze” which rules that a method of execution is unlawful if it creates a “substantial risk of serious harm” or an “objectively intolerable risk of harm” is in a heading in the briefs outline.

This is necessary because allegations are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth.

Finally, the court should determine whether these well-pleaded factual allegations reasonably give rise to an entitlement for relief.
